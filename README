Here's a very simple J2ME app that updates Fire Eagle using user-entered text 
or lat/lon from GPS-enabled phones (using JSR 179).

It won't work if your phone doesn't support JSR 179 (but it should be pretty easy to cut it down to run
on any phone)

Executables are available in /dist.

It uses a library for doing OAuth stuff.  The JAR for that is in /lib (source code coming soon).
The javadoc for FE_OAuth.jar is not great yet -- if you're curious, a good starting place is
the javadoc for FireEagleConsumer (and the MIDlet is a pretty good example of how to use FireEagleConsumer.
